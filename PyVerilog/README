This Python library facilitates parsing Verilog netlists.  It has ONLY ever been tested on flattened gate-level netlists, so I wouldn't expect it to work out of the box on anything else.

requirements.txt
This file lists the dependencies for this library. If you have virtualenv/pip installed (recommended), just do 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


verilogParse.py
This file is based on http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/verilogParse.py
It has been modified to (1) build our Netlist datastructure during parsing and (2) to allow wires with names like "input45"

The rest of the files build the Netlist datastructure.

Example Usage:

See the doctest inside the Netlist class in Netlist.py for some example usage. 
To run the test,

python Netlist.py -v
